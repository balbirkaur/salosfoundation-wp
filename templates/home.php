            Having experience in financial services for over 30 years, I was asked several years ago to assist my
            Reformed Baptist Church in helping the Pastor and Deacons understand how to calculate what is owed by the
            Church to our retiring Pastor.
            <br> <br>
            It became clear to me that our biblically based and doctrinally sound Churches may lack the knowledge of how
            much to provide for their Pastors and their family before it is fiscally too late. If our Church had
            reviewed this earlier, we trust the Lord would have provided the funds.
            <br>
            Pastors or Seminary Students may be reluctant to talk about compensation and how much they need, either they
            don’t really know what that amount is, and/or do not want to be perceived as being too money motivated. This
            noble profession is worthy of double honor.
            <br> <br>
            1 Timothy 5:17 Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in
            the word and doctrine.
            <br> <br>
            We began with this focus; then expanded by God’s Grace to other areas of support for Pastors and Churches
            and formed the The Five Solas Foundation.
            <br> <br>
            We hope you will take a few moments to learn more about what we do; Solo Deo Gloria!
